# Profit-Prediction-of-50-startups
This project aims to predict the profit of startups based on their spending on R&D, administration, and marketing using various regression models.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop models that can accurately predict the profit of startups. We explore four different regression models: Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 50 entries with the following features:
- **R&D Spend**: Expenditure on research and development
- **Administration**: Expenditure on administration
- **Marketing Spend**: Expenditure on marketing
- **Profit**: Profit earned by the startup

## Dependencies
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
